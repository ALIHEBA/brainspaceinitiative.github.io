        Moo K. Chung, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the
        University of Wisconsin-Madison (http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~mchung). Chung is affiliated with the Waisman
        Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior and the Department of Statistics. Chung received PhD from McGill
        University under Keith Wolseley and trained at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Chungâ€™s research focuses on
        computational neuroanatomy, spectral geometry, and topological data analysis. Chung mainly concentrates on the
        methodological development required for quantifying and contrasting brain functional, anatomical shape and
        network variations in both normal and clinical populations using various mathematical, statistical, and
        computational techniques. He has published three books on neuroimage computation including Brain Network
        Analysis published through Cambridge University Press in 2019. Currently started writing a new book on
        Topological Data Analysis for Brain Imaging.

  title: "Topological inference for brain networks in temporal lobe epilepsy using the Wasserstein distance"
  description: "<p>
        Persistent homology summarizes the changes of topological structures in data through over multiple scales called
        filtrations. Doing so detect hidden topological signals that persist over different scales. However, a key
        obstacle of applying persistent homology to brain networks has been the lack of robust statistical inference
        framework. To address this problem, we present a new topological inference procedure based on the Wasserstein
        distance. Our approach has no explicit models and statistical distributional assumptions. The inference is
        performed in a completely data driven fashion. Our metric-based inference significantly differs from traditional
        feature-based topological data analysis (TDA). The method is applied to the resting-state functional magnetic
        resonance images (rs-fMRI) of the temporal lobe epilepsy patients and able to localize brain regions that
        contribute the most to topological differences. We made computer code available at
        <a href="https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/dynamicTDA"> Github </a>. The talk is based on Anand and Chung 2023, IEEE Transactions on
        Medical Imaging (arXiv:2110.14599) and Songdechakraiwut and Chung 2023 Annals of Applied Statistics
        (arXiv:2012.00675).
