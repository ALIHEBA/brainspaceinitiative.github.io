        Moo K. Chung, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the
        University of Wisconsin-Madison (http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~mchung). Chung is affiliated with the Waisman
        Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior and the Department of Statistics. Chung received PhD from McGill
        University under Keith Wolseley and trained at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Chungâ€™s research focuses on
        computational neuroanatomy, spectral geometry, and topological data analysis. Chung mainly concentrates on the
        methodological development required for quantifying and contrasting brain functional, anatomical shape and
        network variations in both normal and clinical populations using various mathematical, statistical, and
        computational techniques. He has published three books on neuroimage computation including Brain Network
        Analysis published through Cambridge University Press in 2019. Currently started writing a new book on
        Topological Data Analysis for Brain Imaging.
