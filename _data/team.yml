  bio: "I attended medical school at the University of Brescia (Italy), completing my residency program in Neurology at University of Brescia (Prof. Alessandro Padovani) in 2012. During this period, I had had the opportunity to increase my expertise in the field of neurodegenerative diseases (Prof. Barbara Borroni, Prof. Alessandro Padovani) from a clinical and research point of view. I focused my research interests on neuroimaging (2007: San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy: Prof. Perani; 2009: SPM course, UCL, London, UK; 2012: Neuroimaging Lab, Fondazione “S.Lucia”, Rome, Italy, Prof. Bozzali). I currently have a permanent contract as clinical neurologist in the Stroke Unit, ASST “Spedali Civili” (Brescia, Italy): my everyday clinical practise is focused on the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with cerebrovascular diseases (ischemic and haemorragic stroke). In parallel, I continued my research activity in collaboration with the Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia. Since my residency period my research interests was focused on the application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) to explore structural and functional correlates of the disease. In the last years I explored in particular: i) the preclinical phase of FTD (studying presymptomatic carriers of FTD causative mutations), ii) the behavioral/neuroimaging correlates in FTD, iii) the neuroanatomical correlates of Cognitive Reserve in FTD, iv) the utilization of advanced statistical approaches to clinical neuroimaging in neurodegenerative diseases."
