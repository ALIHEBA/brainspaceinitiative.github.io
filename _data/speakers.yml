  bio: "I am interested in developing novel algorithms for tracking the dynamic brain connectivity and exploring the underlying physiological meaning of brain dynamics. Human brain is a highly dynamic system characterized by non-stationary neural activities and represented by changing psycho-physical states and mental functions. Identifying brain dynamics from complex neuroimaging signals and exploring the functional relevance of brain dynamics has gained increasing popularity for it is essential towards understanding how brain is organized to support cognitive and affective processes as well as utilization of brain dynamics in neural engineering and clinical applications. My current work could be divided into two parts: the first part focuses on developing new methods for tracking the dynamic brain connectivity; the second part focuses on identifying the brain dynamics and exploring their potential physiological mechanism."

  bio: "Dr. Abrol investigates the development of advanced machine learning and signal processing based deep data fusion frameworks to understand complex interactions in multimodal brain imaging data. Development of such end-to-end trained deep learning models is targeted to facilitate the discovery of crucial non-linear interrelationships between the data modalities, otherwise inaccessible to standard machine learning models. Leveraging this additional wealth of information can enable breakthrough advances in our pursuit of significant neuroimaging objectives such as identifying disease biomarkers at early stages, predicting progression to brain abnormalities and evaluating treatment effects of drugs on individuals with cognitive impairments. Motivated by this, his ongoing research includes assessing the effectiveness of engaging deep learning models to explain vital neuroimaging tasks, with a particular focus on sourcing superior lower-dimensional representations and finer methodical interpretations. Other research interests include exploring complex spatiotemporal associations in brain dynamics wherein his significant contributions include corroborating robustness and disease characterization/prediction utility of time-varying functional connectivity state profiles of the human brain at rest."

  title: "Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology"
  team: true
  bio: "<p>Nice to meet you! I am an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Georgia State University, and I am also affiliated faculty with the GSU Center for Research on the Challenges of Acquiring Language and Literacy and the GSU Neuroscience Institute. Prior to joining the faculty at GSU, I was an Associate Research Scientist in Pediatrics at Yale University. I also completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Haskins Laboratories, where I remain a Research Affiliate.
<p>My research focuses on the brain networks that support reading, spoken language processing, and attentional control. I use neuroimaging to study how these networks overlap, diverge, and change over the course of learning. I also examine how different biological, cognitive, and environmental factors shape the connectivity of these networks. In my research, I work with numerous populations of learners, including school-age children, adolescents, and adults; individuals with reading, language, and/or attention deficits; and individuals who speak or read more than one language.
<p>Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of working with several collaborators in the GSU community to study reading development in children. Using fMRI, we are currently looking at the intersection between the brain networks underlying reading and attentional control (Arrington, Malins, et al., 2019, Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience). We are also following up on a recent study suggesting that a certain amount of variability in brain activity may be beneficial for reading growth (Malins et al., 2018, Journal of Neuroscience). In the future, I am particularly interested in examining how diverse experiences with language – such as bilingual language experience in children – help to shape the brain networks that support literacy skills.
<p>I look forward to continuing to build connections with the neuroimaging community in Atlanta and beyond. Together, I hope we can find ways to connect brain research with current practices in education in order to help individuals reach their learning potential.

  title: ""
  team: true
  bio: "I attended medical school at the University of Brescia (Italy), completing my residency program in Neurology at University of Brescia (Prof. Alessandro Padovani) in 2012. During this period, I had had the opportunity to increase my expertise in the field of neurodegenerative diseases (Prof. Barbara Borroni, Prof. Alessandro Padovani) from a clinical and research point of view. I focused my research interests on neuroimaging  (2007: San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy: Prof. Perani; 2009: SPM course, UCL, London, UK; 2012: Neuroimaging Lab, Fondazione “S.Lucia”, Rome, Italy, Prof. Bozzali). I currently have a permanent contract as clinical neurologist in the Stroke Unit, ASST “Spedali Civili” (Brescia, Italy): my everyday clinical practise is focused on the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with cerebrovascular diseases (ischemic and haemorragic stroke). In parallel, I continued my research activity in collaboration with the Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia. Since my residency period my research interests was focused on the application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) to explore structural and functional correlates of the disease. In the last years I explored in particular: i) the preclinical phase of FTD (studying presymptomatic carriers of FTD causative mutations), ii) the behavioral/neuroimaging correlates in FTD, iii) the neuroanatomical correlates of Cognitive Reserve in FTD, iv) the utilization of advanced statistical approaches to clinical neuroimaging in neurodegenerative diseases."

  bio: "Dr. Plis’s educational background is in engineering (MS), artificial intelligence (MS) and computer science (PhD). His research goals lie in developing computational instruments that enable knowledge extraction from observational multimodal data collected at different temporal and spatial scales. His focus is on understanding systems and processes formed by interactions of multiple “agents”. The human brain, his main application area, is an example of such system: neurons (or measured voxels) are the agents that interact and form networks that themselves are entities of interest with influence structure indicative of mental state, disorder and differences between individuals. Understanding the patterns, networks and interactions can improve our understanding of how the brain works but the data are complex, multidimensional, and neither modality alone carries enough information. The situation typical in many domains with complex incomplete observational measurements including climatology, social sciences, and others. The chosen methodology mainly draws from the fields of machine learning and data science. Specific developments are focused on multimodal pattern recognition, inference, predictive modeling, tracking, and causal learning. Ongoing work is focused on inferring multimodal probabilistic and causal descriptions of function-induced networks based on fusion of fast and slow imaging modalities. This includes feature estimation via deep learning-based pattern recognition and learning causal graphical models."

Having determined that invasive measures were not her preferred techniques, she moved into functional and structural neuroimaging and was fascinated by the ability to measure brain function non-invasively.  Since then, her research program uses neuroimaging of clinical populations to improve understanding of the structural and functional circuitry underlying mental illness and health, and integrates several approaches: The combination of imaging with genetics, to identify genotypes which might help individualize treatment and prognosis; structural and functional imaging across multiple institutions to develop robust clinical neuroimaging studies; use of these neuroimaging methods in schizophrenia and other disorders to determine the relationship between brain volume and functional characteristics with disease status and symptom profiles; and large-scale neuroimaging data sharing to support the international collaborations needed to perform imaging genetics analyses.
