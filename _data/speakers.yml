  bio: "Nice to meet you! I am an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Georgia State University, and I am also affiliated faculty with the GSU Center for Research on the Challenges of Acquiring Language and Literacy and the GSU Neuroscience Institute. Prior to joining the faculty at GSU, I was an Associate Research Scientist in Pediatrics at Yale University. I also completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Haskins Laboratories, where I remain a Research Affiliate.
<br /><br />My research focuses on the brain networks that support reading, spoken language processing, and attentional control. I use neuroimaging to study how these networks overlap, diverge, and change over the course of learning. I also examine how different biological, cognitive, and environmental factors shape the connectivity of these networks. In my research, I work with numerous populations of learners, including school-age children, adolescents, and adults; individuals with reading, language, and/or attention deficits; and individuals who speak or read more than one language.
<br /><br />Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of working with several collaborators in the GSU community to study reading development in children. Using fMRI, we are currently looking at the intersection between the brain networks underlying reading and attentional control (Arrington, Malins, et al., 2019, Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience). We are also following up on a recent study suggesting that a certain amount of variability in brain activity may be beneficial for reading growth (Malins et al., 2018, Journal of Neuroscience). In the future, I am particularly interested in examining how diverse experiences with language – such as bilingual language experience in children – help to shape the brain networks that support literacy skills.
<br /><br />I look forward to continuing to build connections with the neuroimaging community in Atlanta and beyond. Together, I hope we can find ways to connect brain research with current practices in education in order to help individuals reach their learning potential.

  bio: "I attended medical school at the University of Brescia (Italy), completing my residency program in Neurology at University of Brescia (Prof. Alessandro Padovani) in 2012. During this period, I had had the opportunity to increase my expertise in the field of neurodegenerative diseases (Prof. Barbara Borroni, Prof. Alessandro Padovani) from a clinical and research point of view. I focused my research interests on neuroimaging  (2007: San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy: Prof. Perani; 2009: SPM course, UCL, London, UK; 2012: Neuroimaging Lab, Fondazione “S.Lucia”, Rome, Italy, Prof. Bozzali). I currently have a permanent contract as clinical neurologist in the Stroke Unit, ASST “Spedali Civili” (Brescia, Italy): my everyday clinical practise is focused on the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with cerebrovascular diseases (ischemic and haemorragic stroke). In parallel, I continued my research activity in collaboration with the Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia. Since my residency period my research interests was focused on the application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) to explore structural and functional correlates of the disease. In the last years I explored in particular: i) the preclinical phase of FTD (studying presymptomatic carriers of FTD causative mutations), ii) the behavioral/neuroimaging correlates in FTD, iii) the neuroanatomical correlates of Cognitive Reserve in FTD, iv) the utilization of advanced statistical approaches to clinical neuroimaging in neurodegenerative diseases."

  bio: "Dr. Rogers F. Silva is a multidisciplinary scientist with extensive experience developing algorithms for statistical and machine learning, image analysis, numerical optimization, memory-efficient large-scale data reduction, and distributed analyses of big multimodal, multi-subject neuroimaging data.
<br /><br />Interests:
<br />His research interests include · heterogeneous multimodal data fusion · deep statistical and machine learning · image, video and data analysis · multiobjective, combinatorial and constrained optimization · image and signal processing · multimodal neuroimaging
<br /><br />Research:
<br />As a modeling-oriented scientist actively conducting research on novel multimodal multidimensional learning (MML) methods for brain research, Dr. Silva leverages his multidisciplinary background to create new algorithms for deep unsupervised learning that can fully leverage the joint information and shared variability contained in heterogeneous multimodal (or multiview) datasets. He also develops new algorithms for federated learning of private multi-site data, seeking to enable collaborative research that can take advantage of decentralized datasets without requiring direct access to data stored in remote data centers.
<br /><br />Education:
<br />He received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2003 from the Catholic University (PUCRS), Porto Alegre, Brazil, the M.S. degree in Computer Engineering (with minors in Statistics and in Mathematics) in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree (with distinction) in Computer Engineering in 2017, both from The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.
<br /><br />Additional Training:
<br />He also received training in diffusion spectrum imaging at CMU and University of Pittsburgh in 2016, multimodal brain imaging at the MGH Martinos Center and Harvard/MIT in 2016, and deep learning at MILA, University of Montreal in 2017.
<br /><br />Experience:
<br />Before joining the TReNDS Center, Dr. Silva developed novel approaches for multimodal medical image analysis as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Mind Research Network, in addition to client-centric tools and processes using machine learning and statistical analysis as a Data Scientist with Datalytic Solutions. Previously, he also had experience as an engineer, lecturer, and consultant."
