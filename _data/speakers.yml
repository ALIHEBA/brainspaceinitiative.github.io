  bio: "My research interests center on imaging genomics, aiming to characterize the genetic underpinnings of neurobiological traits that further relate to phenotypic manifestations of various mental disorders. My research involves developing computational methods to mine high-dimensional complex data for better understanding of genetic effects on brain at network level, as well as data fusion to integrate different modalities, spanning omic (genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic), neuroimaging (sMRI, fMRI, DTI) and phenotypic levels, to better characterize mental illnesses and facilitate improved patient stratification and more precise treatment planning."

  title: "Research Scientist"
  team: true
  bio: "I am interested in developing novel algorithms for tracking the dynamic brain connectivity and exploring the underlying physiological meaning of brain dynamics. Human brain is a highly dynamic system characterized by non-stationary neural activities and represented by changing psycho-physical states and mental functions. Identifying brain dynamics from complex neuroimaging signals and exploring the functional relevance of brain dynamics has gained increasing popularity for it is essential towards understanding how brain is organized to support cognitive and affective processes as well as utilization of brain dynamics in neural engineering and clinical applications. My current work could be divided into two parts: the first part focuses on developing new methods for tracking the dynamic brain connectivity; the second part focuses on identifying the brain dynamics and exploring their potential physiological mechanism."

  title: "Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology"
  team: true
  bio: "Nice to meet you! I am an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at Georgia State University, and I am also affiliated faculty with the GSU Center for Research on the Challenges of Acquiring Language and Literacy and the GSU Neuroscience Institute. Prior to joining the faculty at GSU, I was an Associate Research Scientist in Pediatrics at Yale University. I also completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Haskins Laboratories, where I remain a Research Affiliate.
<br /><br />My research focuses on the brain networks that support reading, spoken language processing, and attentional control. I use neuroimaging to study how these networks overlap, diverge, and change over the course of learning. I also examine how different biological, cognitive, and environmental factors shape the connectivity of these networks. In my research, I work with numerous populations of learners, including school-age children, adolescents, and adults; individuals with reading, language, and/or attention deficits; and individuals who speak or read more than one language.
<br /><br />Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of working with several collaborators in the GSU community to study reading development in children. Using fMRI, we are currently looking at the intersection between the brain networks underlying reading and attentional control (Arrington, Malins, et al., 2019, Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience). We are also following up on a recent study suggesting that a certain amount of variability in brain activity may be beneficial for reading growth (Malins et al., 2018, Journal of Neuroscience). In the future, I am particularly interested in examining how diverse experiences with language – such as bilingual language experience in children – help to shape the brain networks that support literacy skills.
<br /><br />I look forward to continuing to build connections with the neuroimaging community in Atlanta and beyond. Together, I hope we can find ways to connect brain research with current practices in education in order to help individuals reach their learning potential.

  title: ""
  team: true
  bio: "I attended medical school at the University of Brescia (Italy), completing my residency program in Neurology at University of Brescia (Prof. Alessandro Padovani) in 2012. During this period, I had had the opportunity to increase my expertise in the field of neurodegenerative diseases (Prof. Barbara Borroni, Prof. Alessandro Padovani) from a clinical and research point of view. I focused my research interests on neuroimaging  (2007: San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy: Prof. Perani; 2009: SPM course, UCL, London, UK; 2012: Neuroimaging Lab, Fondazione “S.Lucia”, Rome, Italy, Prof. Bozzali). I currently have a permanent contract as clinical neurologist in the Stroke Unit, ASST “Spedali Civili” (Brescia, Italy): my everyday clinical practise is focused on the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients with cerebrovascular diseases (ischemic and haemorragic stroke). In parallel, I continued my research activity in collaboration with the Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia. Since my residency period my research interests was focused on the application of advanced neuroimaging techniques to neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) to explore structural and functional correlates of the disease. In the last years I explored in particular: i) the preclinical phase of FTD (studying presymptomatic carriers of FTD causative mutations), ii) the behavioral/neuroimaging correlates in FTD, iii) the neuroanatomical correlates of Cognitive Reserve in FTD, iv) the utilization of advanced statistical approaches to clinical neuroimaging in neurodegenerative diseases."

  bio: "Dr. Liu’s research focuses on exploring and identifying genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic effects on or association with brain anomalies related to various mental illnesses and disorders, as well as understanding normal brain development. Her research involves developing methods to unveil hidden relations between various phenotypes and genetic/epigenetic features across the whole genome. The brain-based phenotypes can be extracted from MRI images, EEG and MEG signals, while the genetic and epigenetic features are from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), copy number variations (CNV), DNA methylation, and gene expression. Due to complexity of data, various types of methods/algorithms are being developed and extended, including multimodal feature extraction, multivariate association, multilayer networks, and statistical models. The disorders being studied include, but not limited to, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, ADHD, mood disorders.

His research goals lie in developing computational instruments that enable knowledge extraction from observational multimodal data collected at different temporal and spatial scales. His focus is on understanding systems and processes formed by interactions of multiple “agents”. The human brain, his main application area, is an example of such system: neurons (or measured voxels) are the agents that interact and form networks that themselves are entities of interest with influence structure indicative of mental state, disorder and differences between individuals. Understanding the patterns, networks and interactions can improve our understanding of how the brain works but the data are complex, multidimensional, and neither modality alone carries enough information. The situation typical in many domains with complex incomplete observational measurements including climatology, social sciences, and others. The chosen methodology mainly draws from the fields of machine learning and data science. Specific developments are focused on multimodal pattern recognition, inference, predictive modeling, tracking, and causal learning. Ongoing work is focused on inferring multimodal probabilistic and causal descriptions of function-induced networks based on fusion of fast and slow imaging modalities. This includes feature estimation via deep learning-based pattern recognition and learning causal graphical models."

He is furthermore a visiting professor at the Chinese Academy of Science Institute of Automation. Working at the interface between neuroanatomy, data-science and brain medicine, he aims to obtain a more detailed characterization of the organization of the human brain and its inter-individual variability in order to better understand its changes in advanced age as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders. This goal is pursued by the development and application of novel analysis tools and approaches for large-scale, multi-modal analysis of brain structure, function and connectivity as well as by machine-learning for single subject prediction of cognitive and socio-affective traits and ultimately precision medicine.
