  bio: "I have studied Electronics and Communication Engineering at the Politecnico of Torin (IT) and I am now at my last year of the Master degree in Electrical Engineering at Delft University of Technology (NL). I am working with EEG signals for the detection of Epilepsy, using graph signal processing. My interests are multiple and they lie at the intersection of neuroscience, signal processing and machine learning. After my Master I aim to pursue a Ph.D focusing on Epilepsy prediction or detection. I am super excited of being part of this group and cannot wait for the opportunity to grow and learn new things together!:grinning:"

  bio: "I am a data scientist with a passion for the development and application of statistical and computational methods to understand and solve complex problems. I have a strong background in digital signal processing, training and research experience with unsupervised and supervised learning methods, experience with data wrangling and data cleaning of large (>2TB) data sets, and with the execution of experiments in high-performance clusters using Slurm and batch scripts. I also have extensive experience as a Linux user and administrator. In general, I like to strike a balance between a solid theoretical understanding of the mathematical methods and the software development needed to solve problems."
